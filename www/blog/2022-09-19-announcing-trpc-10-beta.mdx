tRPC has already changed how many people think about APIs and about the boundaries between frontend and backend. Since we released our last major about a year ago, we've gotten 11,000+ more stars on GitHub, thousands more applications using tRPC, and countless members of our community giving us feedback & from this, we've learned a lot.

The developer experience in version 10 of tRPC is unparalleled; the boundaries between backend and frontend are truly blurred, we've worked very hard at addressing the TypeScript performance issues many of you have faced and we are we have created something we are convinced you will love to work with.

## Massively improved performance

TypeScript enables us to do very cool things, but it comes at a cost. Many of the things that we (ab)use in tRPC, are very heavy on the compiler, and as a result, you might have experienced your IDE slowing down as your application grows. In v10, we've improved this massively.

We've done this through changing our API that allows TypeScript to be a lot faster, especially during incremental compilation, allowing your IDE to remain snappy.

## Improved DX

There was still a drift.

## And so much more

When working with tRPC v9, you might have experienced that your IDE started getting sluggish when getting big when working with tRPC
