tRPC offers a first class integration with React. Under the hood this is simply a wrapper around the very popular [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), so we recommend that you familiarise yourself with React Query, as their docs go in to much greater depth on its usage.

:::tip
If you are using Next.js we recommend using [our integration with that](/docs/nextjs/introduction) instead

### The tRPC React Query Integration

This library enables usage directly within React components

```tsx title='pages/IndexPage.tsx'
import { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';

export default function IndexPage() {
  const helloQuery = trpc.hello.useQuery({ name: 'Bob' });
  const goodbyeMutation = trpc.goodbye.useMutation();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{helloQuery.data?.greeting}</p>

      <button onClick={() => goodbyteMutation.mutate()}>Say Goodbye</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Differences to vanilla React Query

The wrapper abstracts some aspects of React Query for you:

- Query Keys - these are generated and managed by tRPC on your behalf, based on the procedure inputs you provide
  - If you need the query key which tRPC calculates, you can use [getQueryKey](/docs/reactjs/getquerykey)
- Type safe by default - the types you provide in your tRPC Backend also drive the types of your React Query client, providing safety throughout your React app
