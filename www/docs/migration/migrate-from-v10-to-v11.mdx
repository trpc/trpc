:::info
This is a current work in progress representing **version 11**.

- The functionality is **stable and can be used in production**, but we may do small breaking API-changes between patches until we reach `11.0.0`
- The packages are published with the `next`-tag on npm

:::

### Installation / upgrading

import { InstallSnippet } from '@site/src/components/InstallSnippet';

<InstallSnippet pkgs="@trpc/server@next @trpc/client@next @trpc/react-query@next @trpc/next@next @tanstack/react-query@latest @tanstack/react-query-devtools@latest" />

## Reverse-chronological changelog

> This is a draft document. It will be updated to a proper guide as we get closer to the v11 release.
> The only major thing that will incur work for you is that you will need to do is to update TanStack Query to v5.0.0.

### Moved `Procedure._def._output_in` / `Procedure._def._input_in` to `Procedure._def.$types` (non-breaking)

This is a breaking change for tRPC internals, but should not affect you as a user.

You don't have to do anything, unless you're using `Procedure._def._output_in` or `Procedure._def._input_in` directly in your code.

### Explicit Content-Type checks (non-breaking)

We now have explicit checks for the `Content-Type`-header when doing POST-requests. This means that if you send a request with a `Content-Type` that doesn't match the expected one, you will get a `415 Unsupported Media Type`-error.

Our tRPC clients already sends content-type headers, so is only a potential breaking change if you call tRPC manually.

### Added support for method overriding

Allows you to override the HTTP method for procedures to always be sent with `POST` in order to get around some limitations with e.g. max URL lengths.

Closes [#3910](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/issues/3910)

### Added support for bi-directional infinite queries

See [`useInfiniteQuery()`](../client/react/useInfiniteQuery.md)

### Added `inferProcedureBuilderResolverOptions<T>`-helper (non-breaking)

Adds a helper to infer the options for a procedure builder resolver. This is useful if you want to create reusable functions for different procedures.

See test [here](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/743fa6aed8ac889d9c60f321c4b4ad060b56e791/packages/server/src/unstable-core-do-not-import/procedureBuilder.test.ts#L36-L231) for a reference on how to use it

### Transformers are moved to links (breaking)

> TypeScript will guide you through this migration
>
> Only applies if you use data transformers.

You now setup data transformers in the `links`-array instead of when you initialize the tRPC-client;

Wherever you have a HTTP Link you have to add `transformer: superjson` if you use transformers:

```ts
httpBatchLink({
  url: '/api/trpc',
  transformer: superjson, // <-- add this
});
```

```ts
createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({
  // [..]
  transformer: superjson, // <-- add this
});
```

### `@trpc/next` ssr mode now requires a prepass helper with `ssr: true`

This is to fix https://github.com/trpc/trpc/issues/5378 where `react-dom` was imported regardless if you were using this functionality or not.

See [SSR docs](../client/nextjs/ssr.md)

### Added support for short-hand router definitions (non-breaking)

See [Merging routers](../server/merging-routers.md#defining-an-inline-sub-router-inline-sub-router)

```ts
const appRouter = router({
  // Shorthand plain object for creating a sub-router
  nested1: {
    proc: publicProcedure.query(() => '...'),
  },
  // Equivalent of:
  nested2: router({
    proc: publicProcedure.query(() => '...'),
  }),
});
```

### Deleted `inferHandlerInput<T>` and `ProcedureArgs<T>` (non-breaking for most)

> If these types mean nothing for you or your codebase, just ignore this

Use `inferProcedureInput<TProcedure>` instead & `TRPCProcedureOptions` instead

### Added `useSuspenseQueries()`

See [useSuspenseQueries](../client/react/suspense.md#usesuspensequeries)

https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/5226

### Refactor internal generics (breaking)

We have refactored our internal generics and made them more readable (TODO: link procedure builder sauce)

### React is now >=18.2.0 (breaking)

Check their migration guide: https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide

### `wsLink` improvements (minor)

- Ability to pass a `Promise` in the `url`-callback if servers switch location during deploys
- Added new `lazy` option that makes the websocket automatically disconnect when there are no pending requests

### `rawInput` in middleware is now a `getRawInput` (breaking)

While we're not doing anything differently internally (just yet) this is help support a much requested feature in tRPC: content types other than JSON.

### Simplified types and `.d.ts` outputs

Procedures in your router now only emit their input & output - where before they would also contain the full context object for every procedure, leading to unnecessary complexity in e.g. `.d.ts`.

### React Query peerDep is now v5 (breaking)

Check their migration guide: https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/guides/migrating-to-v5

### Exports names `AbcProxyXyz` has been renamed to `AbcXyz` (non-breaking)

The proxy names were due to v9 using the `AbcXyz` names, these have been removed and the proxy ones have been renamed to the non-proxy names, e.g:

- `createTRPCClient` was deprecated from v9, and is now completely removed. The `createTRPCProxyClient` has been renamed to `createTRPCClient` instead. `createTRPCProxyClient` is now marked as deprecated.

### SSG Helpers (non-breaking for most)

- `createSSGHelpers` were for v9 which has now been removed. the v10 equivalent `createProxySSGHelpers` have been renamed to `createSSGHelpers` now instead.
- `createProxySSGHelpers` is now deprecated but aliased to `createSSGHelpers` for backwards compatibility.
- Removed exported type `CreateSSGHelpersOptions`

### `interop`-mode has been removed

We have removed the `interop`-mode from tRPC. This was a mode that allowed you to have an easy transition period from v9 to v10. This mode was never meant to be supported long-term and we have now removed it.
