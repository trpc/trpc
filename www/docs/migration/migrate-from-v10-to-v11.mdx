:::info
This is a current work in progress representing **version 11**.

- The functionality is **stable and can be used in production**, but we may do small breaking API-changes between patches until we reach `11.0.0`
- The packages are published with the `next`-tag on npm

:::

### Installation / upgrading

import { InstallSnippet } from '@site/src/components/InstallSnippet';

<InstallSnippet pkgs="@trpc/server@next @trpc/client@next @trpc/react-query@next @trpc/next@next @tanstack/react-query@latest @tanstack/react-query-devtools@latest" />

## Reverse-chronological changelog

> This is a draft document. It will be updated to a proper guide as we get closer to the v11 release.
> The only major thing that will incur work for you is that you will need to do is to update TanStack Query to v5.0.0.

### Subscription procedure output type changed to `AsyncGenerator` (non-breaking)

If you've used subscriptions with async generators with the v11, this might be breaking with how you infer your types.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

We changed the inferred output from:

```ts
SubscriptionProcedure<{
  input: __INPUT__;
  output: __OUTPUT__;
}>;
```

to

```ts
SubscriptionProcedure<{
  input: __INPUT__;
  output: AsyncGenerator<__OUTPUT__, void, unknown>;
}>;
```

If you need to infer the value you can use a helper like the below:

```ts
type inferAsyncIterableYield<TOutput> = TOutput extends AsyncGenerator<
  infer $Yield
>
  ? $Yield
  : never;
```

</details>

This change has been made to ensure the library remains compatible with future updates and allows for the use of the `return` type in subscriptions' `AsyncGenerator`s.

See [subscriptions docs](../server/subscriptions.md#output-validators) for more information.

### Added support for output validators in subscriptions (non-breaking)

See [subscriptions docs](../server/subscriptions.md#output-validators) for more information.

### Deprecation of subscriptions returning `Observable`s (non-breaking)

We now support returning async generator function for subscriptions and we previously added a [`httpSubscriptionLink`](../client/links/httpSubscriptionLink.md).

To see how to use async generator functions for subscriptions see the [subscriptions docs](../server/subscriptions.md).

### Removal of `AbortControllerEsque`-ponyfill (rarely breaking)

We have removed the `AbortControllerEsque`-ponyfill from tRPC, if you need to support older browsers you can use a polyfill like `abortcontroller-polyfill`.

### Support for Server-sent events (SSE) (non-breaking)

We now support SSE for subscriptions, this means that you don't need to spin up a WebSocket server to get real-time updates in your application & that the client can automatically reconnect and resume if the connection is lost.

👉 [See more in the `httpSubscriptionLink` docs](../client/links/httpSubscriptionLink.md).

### Support for streaming responses over HTTP (non-breaking)

We now support streaming mutations and queries using the [`httpBatchStreamLink`](../client/links/httpBatchStreamLink.md#generators).

This means that query and mutation resolvers can either be [`AsyncGenerator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncGenerator)s with `yield` or return promises that can be deferred for later and you can use stream responses over HTTP, without using WebSockets.

We want your feedback on this feature, so please try it out and let us know what you think in the [`🎏-rfc-streaming`-channel on our Discord](https://trpc.io/discord)!

👉 [See more in the `httpBatchStreamLink` docs](../client/links/httpBatchStreamLink.md#generators)

### `resolveHTTPRequest` has been replaced by `resolveRequest` that uses Fetch APIs (rarely breaking)

The function `resolveHTTPRequest` has been replaced by `resolveRequest` which uses the Fetch API - [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)/[`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

This is a breaking change for HTTP-adapters, but should not affect you as a user.

If you're building an adapter, check out how our adapters work [in the code](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/tree/next/packages/server/src/adapters) and don't be a stranger to ask for help in our [Discord](https://trpc.io/discord).

### `TRPCRequestInfo` has been updated (rarely breaking)

Inputs are now materialised lazily when required by the procedure, which means the input and procedure type is no longer available when tRPC calls `createContext`.

You can still access the input by calling `info.calls[index].getRawInput()`.

### All the experimental form-data support has been replaced (rarely breaking)

> This only affects you if you used the experimental formdata features

- experimental_formDataLink - use httpLink
- experimental_parseMultipartFormData - not needed anymore
- experimental_isMultipartFormDataRequest - not needed anymore
- experimental_composeUploadHandlers - not needed anymore
- experimental_createMemoryUploadHandler - not needed anymore
- experimental_NodeOnDiskFile and experimental_createFileUploadHandler - not supported in this first release, open an issue if you need to hold data on disk
- experimental_contentTypeHandlers - not needed anymore, but could come back if needed by the community for novel data types

You can see the new approach in `examples/next-formdata`

### Moved `Procedure._def._output_in` / `Procedure._def._input_in` to `Procedure._def.$types` (non-breaking)

This is a breaking change for tRPC internals, but should not affect you as a user.

You don't have to do anything, unless you're using `Procedure._def._output_in` or `Procedure._def._input_in` directly in your code.

### Explicit Content-Type checks (non-breaking)

We now have explicit checks for the `Content-Type`-header when doing POST-requests. This means that if you send a request with a `Content-Type` that doesn't match the expected one, you will get a `415 Unsupported Media Type`-error.

Our tRPC clients already sends content-type headers, so is only a potential breaking change if you call tRPC manually.

### Added support for method overriding (rarely breaking)

Allows you to override the HTTP method for procedures to always be sent with `POST` in order to get around some limitations with e.g. max URL lengths.

Closes [#3910](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/issues/3910)

### Added support for bi-directional infinite queries (non-breaking)

See [`useInfiniteQuery()`](../client/react/useInfiniteQuery.md)

### Added `inferProcedureBuilderResolverOptions<T>`-helper (non-breaking)

Adds a helper to infer the options for a procedure builder resolver. This is useful if you want to create reusable functions for different procedures.

See test [here](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/743fa6aed8ac889d9c60f321c4b4ad060b56e791/packages/server/src/unstable-core-do-not-import/procedureBuilder.test.ts#L36-L231) for a reference on how to use it

### Transformers are moved to links (breaking)

> TypeScript will guide you through this migration
>
> Only applies if you use data transformers.

You now setup data transformers in the `links`-array instead of when you initialize the tRPC-client;

Wherever you have a HTTP Link you have to add `transformer: superjson` if you use transformers:

```ts
httpBatchLink({
  url: '/api/trpc',
  transformer: superjson, // <-- add this
});
```

```ts
createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({
  // [..]
  transformer: superjson, // <-- add this
});
```

### `@trpc/next` ssr mode now requires a prepass helper with `ssr: true` (rarely breaking)

This is to fix https://github.com/trpc/trpc/issues/5378 where `react-dom` was imported regardless if you were using this functionality or not.

See [SSR docs](../client/nextjs/ssr.md)

### Added support for short-hand router definitions (non-breaking)

See [Merging routers](../server/merging-routers.md#inline-sub-router)

```ts
const appRouter = router({
  // Shorthand plain object for creating a sub-router
  nested1: {
    proc: publicProcedure.query(() => '...'),
  },
  // Equivalent of:
  nested2: router({
    proc: publicProcedure.query(() => '...'),
  }),
});
```

### Deleted `inferHandlerInput<T>` and `ProcedureArgs<T>` (non-breaking for most)

> If these types mean nothing for you or your codebase, just ignore this

Use `inferProcedureInput<TProcedure>` instead & `TRPCProcedureOptions` instead

### Added `useSuspenseQueries()`

See [useSuspenseQueries](../client/react/suspense.md#usesuspensequeries)

https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/5226

### Refactor internal generics (rarely breaking)

We have refactored our internal generics and made them more readable (TODO: link procedure builder sauce)

### React is now >=18.2.0 (rarely breaking)

Check their migration guide: https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide

### NodeJS 18+ and Modern Browsers are now required (rarely breaking)

We have added usage of FormData, File, Blob, and ReadableStream. NodeJS 18 is now required, though these have been supported by browsers for many years now.

### `wsLink` improvements (minor)

- Ability to pass a `Promise` in the `url`-callback if servers switch location during deploys
- Added new `lazy` option that makes the websocket automatically disconnect when there are no pending requests

### `rawInput` in middleware is now a `getRawInput` (rarely breaking)

While we're not doing anything differently internally (just yet) this is help support a much requested feature in tRPC: content types other than JSON.

### Simplified types and `.d.ts` outputs

Procedures in your router now only emit their input & output - where before they would also contain the full context object for every procedure, leading to unnecessary complexity in e.g. `.d.ts`.

### React Query peerDep is now v5 (breaking)

Check their migration guide: https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/guides/migrating-to-v5

### Exports names `AbcProxyXyz` has been renamed to `AbcXyz` (non-breaking)

The proxy names were due to v9 using the `AbcXyz` names, these have been removed and the proxy ones have been renamed to the non-proxy names, e.g:

- `createTRPCClient` was deprecated from v9, and is now completely removed. The `createTRPCProxyClient` has been renamed to `createTRPCClient` instead. `createTRPCProxyClient` is now marked as deprecated.

### SSG Helpers (rarely breaking)

- `createSSGHelpers` were for v9 which has now been removed. the v10 equivalent `createProxySSGHelpers` have been renamed to `createSSGHelpers` now instead.
- `createProxySSGHelpers` is now deprecated but aliased to `createSSGHelpers` for backwards compatibility.
- Removed exported type `CreateSSGHelpersOptions`

### `interop`-mode has been removed (rarely breaking)

We have removed the `interop`-mode from tRPC. This was a mode that allowed you to have an easy transition period from v9 to v10. This mode was never meant to be supported long-term and we have now removed it.
