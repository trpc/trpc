description: A link for direct procedure calls without HTTP overhead
---

The `localLink` is a special link that allows you to make tRPC procedure calls directly in your application without going through HTTP.

:::info
We have prefixed this as `experimental_` as it's a new API! [Read more](/docs/faq#experimental).
:::

## Usage

```tsx
import { createTRPCClient, experimental_localLink } from '@trpc/client';
import type { AppRouter } from '../server';

const client = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [
    experimental_localLink({
      router: appRouter,
      createContext: async () => {
        // Create your context here
        return {};
      },
      onError: (opts) => {
        // Log errors here
        console.error('Error:', opts.error);
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Features

- Direct procedure calls without HTTP overhead
- Full support for queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- Automatic error handling and transformation
- Support for abort signals
- Type-safe context creation

## Options

The `localLink` accepts the following options:

```ts
type LocalLinkOptions<TRouter extends AnyRouter> = {
  router: TRouter;
  createContext: () => Promise<inferRouterContext<TRouter>>;
  onError?: (opts: ErrorHandlerOptions<inferRouterContext<TRouter>>) => void;
} & TransformerOptions<inferClientTypes<TRouter>>;
```

### router

The tRPC router instance to use for procedure calls.

### createContext

A function that creates the context for each procedure call. This is called for each request and should return a promise that resolves to the context object.

### onError

An optional error handler that is called when an error occurs during a procedure call. It receives the error, operation type, path, input, and context.

### transformer

Optional input/output transformers for serialization/deserialization of data.

## Notes

- It's recommended to use this link in scenarios where you need direct procedure calls without HTTP
- For most client-side applications, you should use the `httpLink` or other HTTP-based links instead
- The link supports all tRPC features including queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- Error handling and transformation are handled automatically, just like with HTTP-based links
