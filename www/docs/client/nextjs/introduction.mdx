### tRPC + Next.js

Next.js makes it easy to build a client and server together in one codebase. tRPC makes it easy to share types between them, ensuring typesafety for your application's data fetching.

tRPC provides first-class support for both the **App Router** and the **Pages Router**. Choose the guide that matches your project:

## App Router

The recommended approach for new Next.js projects. Uses React Server Components, the [fetch adapter](/docs/server/adapters/fetch), and [`@trpc/tanstack-react-query`](/docs/client/tanstack-react-query).

Key features:
- **Server Components** - Prefetch data on the server and stream it to the client
- **Streaming** - Leverage Next.js streaming for optimal loading performance
- **Suspense** - Use `useSuspenseQuery` with Suspense boundaries for loading states

**[Get started with App Router &rarr;](/docs/client/nextjs/app-router-setup)**

## Pages Router

Uses `@trpc/next` which provides a higher-order component (HOC) and integrated hooks for the Pages Router data-fetching patterns.

Key features:
- **Server-side rendering** - Render pages on the server and hydrate them on the client. Read more about [SSR](/docs/client/nextjs/ssr).
- **Static site generation** - Prefetch queries on the server and generate static HTML files. Read more about [SSG](/docs/client/nextjs/ssg).
- **Automatic Provider Wrapping** - `@trpc/next` provides a HOC that wraps your app with the necessary providers automatically.

## Choosing between App Router and Pages Router

| | App Router | Pages Router |
|---|---|---|
| **Recommended for** | New projects | Existing Pages Router projects |
| **Data fetching** | Server Components, `prefetchQuery` | `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, SSR via HOC |
| **Server adapter** | [Fetch adapter](/docs/server/adapters/fetch) | [Next.js adapter](/docs/server/adapters/nextjs) |
| **Client package** | `@trpc/tanstack-react-query` | `@trpc/next` + `@trpc/react-query` |
| **Provider setup** | Manual `QueryClientProvider` + `TRPCProvider` | Automatic via `withTRPC()` HOC |

:::tip
If you're starting a new project, we recommend the App Router. If you have an existing Pages Router project, the Pages Router integration works well and is fully supported.
