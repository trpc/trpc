# Test without watch

When running tests, use the `--watch false` flag to avoid watch mode:

We're using Vitest workspaces for testing.

Examples:

- `pnpm test -- --watch false`
- `pnpm test -- --watch false <test-file>`

Tests are always run from the root of the project, even if you're in a subdirectory.
