# Changes in v11

## `interop`-mode has been removed

...

## SSG Helpers

`createSSGHelpers` were for v9 which has now been removed. the v10 equivalent `createProxySSGHelpers` have been renamed to `createSSGHelpers` now instead. `createProxySSGHelpers` is now deprecated but aliased to `createSSGHelpers` for backwards compatibility.
