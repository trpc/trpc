## Introduction

**Fumadocs is very flexible.** You can integrate with any content source, even without an official adapter.

> This guide assumes you are experienced with Next.js App Router.

### Examples

You can see examples to use Fumadocs with a CMS, which allows a nice experience on publishing content, and real-time update without re-building the app.

- [BaseHub](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs-basehub)
- [Sanity](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs-sanity)

For a custom content source implementation, you will need:

### Page Tree

You can either hardcode the page tree, or write some code to generate one.
See [Definitions of Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree).

Pass your Page Tree to `DocsLayout` (usually in a `layout.tsx`).

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { DocsLayout } from 'fumadocs-ui/layouts/docs';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <DocsLayout
      nav={{ title: 'Example Docs' }}
      tree={
        {
          /// your own tree
        }
      }
    >
      {children}
    </DocsLayout>
  );
}
```

The page tree is like a smarter "sidebar items", they will be referenced everywhere in the UI for navigation elements, such as the page footer.

### Docs Page

Same as a normal Next.js app, the code of your docs page is located in `[[...slug]]/page.tsx`.

#### SSG

Define the [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) function.
It should return a list of parameters (`params`) to populate the `[[...slug]]` catch-all route.

#### Body

In the main body of page, find the corresponding page according to the slug and render its content inside the `DocsPage` component.

You also need table of contents, which can be generated with your own implementation, or using the [`getTableOfContents`](/docs/headless/utils/get-toc) utility (Markdown/MDX only).

```tsx
import { DocsBody, DocsPage } from 'fumadocs-ui/page';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
import { getPage } from './my-content-source';

export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
  const page = getPage(params.slug);
  if (!page) notFound();

  return (
    <DocsPage toc={page.tableOfContents}>
      <DocsBody>{page.render()}</DocsBody>
    </DocsPage>
  );
}
```

#### Metadata

Next.js offers a Metadata API for SEO, you can configure it with `generateMetadata` (similar as the code above).

### Document Search

This can be difficult considering your content may not be necessarily Markdown/MDX.
For Markdown and MDX, the built-in [Search API](/docs/headless/search/orama) is adequate for most use cases.
Otherwise, you will have to bring your own implementation.

We recommend 3rd party solutions like Algolia Search. They are more flexible than the built-in Search API, and is easier to integrate with remote sources.
Fumadocs offers a simple [Algolia Search Adapter](/docs/headless/search/algolia), which includes a search client to integrate with Fumadocs UI.

## MDX Remote

Fumadocs offers the **MDX Remote** package, it is a helper to integrate Markdown-based content sources with Fumadocs.
You can think it as a `next-mdx-remote` with built-in plugins for Fumadocs.

### Setup

```package-install
@fumadocs/mdx-remote
```

The main feature it offers is the MDX Compiler, it can compile MDX content to JSX nodes.
Since it doesn't use a bundler, there's some limitations:

- No imports and exports in MDX files.

It's compatible with Server Components. For example:

```tsx
import { getMDXComponents } from '@/mdx-components';
import { compileMDX } from '@fumadocs/mdx-remote';
import { DocsBody, DocsPage } from 'fumadocs-ui/page';
import { getPage } from './my-content-source';

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: { slug?: string[] };
}) {
  const page = getPage(params.slug);
  const compiled = await compileMDX({
    source: page.content,
  });

  const MdxContent = compiled.body;

  return (
    <DocsPage toc={compiled.toc}>
      <DocsBody>
        <MdxContent components={getMDXComponents()} />
      </DocsBody>
    </DocsPage>
  );
}
```

#### Images

On some platforms like Vercel, the original `public` folder (including static assets like images) will be removed after `next build`.
`compileMDX` might no longer be able to access local images in `public`.

When referencing images, make sure to use a URL.
