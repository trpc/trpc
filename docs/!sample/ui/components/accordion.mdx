## Usage

Based on
[Radix UI Accordion](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/accordion), useful for FAQ sections.

```mdx
import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="My Title">My Content</Accordion>
</Accordions>
```

### Accordions

<AutoTypeTable path="./content/docs/ui/props.ts" name="AccordionsProps" />

### Accordion

<AutoTypeTable path="./content/docs/ui/props.ts" name="AccordionProps" />

### Linking to Accordion

You can specify an `id` for accordion. The accordion will automatically open when the user is navigating to the page with the specified `id` in hash parameter.

```mdx
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="My Title" id="my-title">

My Content

</Accordion>
</Accordions>
```

> The value of accordion is same as title by default. When an id presents, it will be used as the value instead.
