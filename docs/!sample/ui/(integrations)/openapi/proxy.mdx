title: Creating Proxy
description: Avoid CORS problem

## Introduction

A proxy server is useful for executing HTTP (`fetch`) requests, as it doesn't have CORS constraints like on the browser.
We can use it for executing HTTP requests on the OpenAPI playground, when the target API endpoints do not have CORS configured correctly.

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  Do not use this on unreliable sites and API endpoints, the proxy server will
  forward all received headers & body, including HTTP-only `Cookies` and
  `Authorization` header.
</Callout>

### Setup

Create a route handler for proxy server.

```ts title="/api/proxy/route.ts"
import { openapi } from '@/lib/source';

export const { GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE } = openapi.createProxy({
  // optional, we recommend to set a list of allowed origins for proxied requests
  allowedOrigins: ['https://example.com'],
});
```

> Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/ui/openapi) guide if `openapi` server is not yet configured.

And enable the proxy from `createOpenAPI`.

```ts title="lib/source.ts"
import { createOpenAPI } from 'fumadocs-openapi/server';

export const openapi = createOpenAPI({
  proxyUrl: '/api/proxy', // [!code ++]
});
```
