Fumadocs was created because I wanted a more customisable experience for building docs, to be a docs framework that is not opinionated, **a "framework" that you can break**.

## Philosophy

**Less Abstraction:** Fumadocs expects you to write code and cooperate with the rest of your software.
While most frameworks are configured with a configuration file, they usually lack flexibility when you hope to tune its details.
You can’t control how they render the page nor the internal logic. Fumadocs shows you how the app works, instead of a single configuration file.

**Next.js Fundamentals:** It gives you the utilities and a good-looking UI.
You are still using features of Next.js App Router, like **Static Site Generation**. There is nothing new for Next.js developers, so you can use it with confidence.

**Opinionated on UI:** The only thing Fumadocs UI (the default theme) offers is **User Interface**. The UI is opinionated for bringing better mobile responsiveness and user experience.
Instead, we use a much more flexible approach inspired by Shadcn UI — [Fumadocs CLI](/docs/cli), so we can iterate our design quick, and welcome for more feedback about the UI.

## Why Fumadocs

Fumadocs is designed with flexibility in mind.

You can use `fumadocs-core` as a headless UI library and bring your own styles.
Fumadocs MDX is also a useful library to handle MDX content in Next.js. It also includes:

- Many built-in components.
- Typescript Twoslash, OpenAPI, and Math (KaTeX) integrations.
- Fast and optimized by default, natively built on App Router.
- Tight integration with Next.js, you can add it to an existing Next.js project easily.

### Documentation

Fumadocs focuses on **authoring experience**, it provides a beautiful theme and many docs automation tools.

It helps you to iterate your codebase faster while never leaving your docs behind.
You can take this site as an example of docs site built with Fumadocs.

### Blog sites

Since Next.js is already a powerful framework, most features can be implemented with **just Next.js**.

Fumadocs provides additional tooling for Next.js, including syntax highlighting, document search, and a default theme (Fumadocs UI).
It helps you to avoid reinventing the wheels.

## When to use Fumadocs

For most of the web applications, vanilla React.js is no longer enough.
Nowadays, we also wish to have a blog, a showcase page, a FAQ page, etc. With a
fancy UI that's breathtaking, in these cases, Fumadocs can help you build the
docs easier, with less boilerplate.

Fumadocs is maintained by Fuma and many contributors, with care on the maintainability of codebase.
While we don't aim to offer every functionality people wanted, we're more focused on making basic features perfect and well-maintained.
You can also help Fumadocs to be more useful by contributing!
