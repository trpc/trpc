## Usage

### Markdown

Specify the target Markdown file path in the `<include>` tag (relative to the Markdown file itself).

```mdx title="page.mdx"
<include>./another.mdx</include>
```

This will display the content from the target file (e.g. `another.mdx`).

### CodeBlock

For other types of files, it will become a codeblock:

```mdx title="page.mdx"
<include>./script.ts</include>

<include lang="tsx" meta='title="lib.ts"'>
  ./script.ts
</include>
```

### `cwd`

Resolve relative paths from cwd instead of the Markdown file:

```mdx
<include cwd lang="tsx" meta='title="lib.ts"'>
  ./script.ts
</include>
```
