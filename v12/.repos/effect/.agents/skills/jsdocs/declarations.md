# Tags, Modules, And Links

## Declaration Shape

Use a multiline JSDoc block for a public declaration:

````ts
/**
 * Short description as one paragraph.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Optional practical usage guidance.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Optional details for complex behavior.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Optional concrete caveats.
 *
 * **Example** (Parsing JSON)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * operation() // => expected
 * ```
 *
 * @category constructors
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
````

Write practical English about the public concept, not its implementation. Start
functions and methods with a present-tense action such as `Creates`, `Returns`,
or `Converts`; match nearby noun families for values, such as `Schema for`,
`Layer that`, or `Service that`.

Optional non-empty sections appear once in this order: `**When to use**`,
`**Details**`, `**Gotchas**`. Separate descriptions, sections, examples, and
tags with exactly one blank line. Use prose for one fact and bullets for
parallel facts. Do not add other headings.

`**When to use**` states a positive use case distinct from the description and
begins with `Use to`, `Use when`, `Use as`, or `Use with`. Put sibling
comparisons in `@see`. Reserve `**Gotchas**` for concrete preconditions, edge
cases, surprising behavior, and important failure modes.

## Tags

Declaration tags appear in this order:

1. `@deprecated`
2. `@default`
3. `@see`
4. `@stability`
5. `@category`
6. `@since`

- Roots require stable-semver `@since` and no `@default`; category requirements
  live in [categories.md](categories.md).
- Namespaces and their declarations require stable-semver `@since`, permit
  `@category`, and reject `@default`.
- Member JSDoc is optional; when present it permits stable-semver `@since` and
  non-empty `@default`, rejects `@category`, and follows the prose contract.
- Any declaration permits one non-empty `@deprecated` and repeated non-empty
  `@see` tags.
- Roots, export specifiers, and root namespaces require `@stability stable`,
  `@stability unstable`, or `@stability experimental`. Use `unstable` when an
  API may receive breaking changes in minor releases, `experimental` when it may
  receive breaking changes across patch versions, and `stable` otherwise.
- Tag any API that exposes a third-party dependency `@stability unstable`: an
  accessor to the underlying client or instance, options typed as the
  dependency's options, constructors that accept its instances, re-exports of
  it, and signatures that mention its types. Tag the whole module when it exists
  to wrap the dependency; otherwise tag only the exposing declarations or
  members. Runtime built-ins (Node, Bun, Deno, DOM) and framework types inherent
  to a binding (React, Solid, Vue) are exempt.

Use canonical `**Example**` sections rather than `@example` tags or loose code
fences.

## Modules And Links

When present, the first top-level JSDoc is the module block unless TypeScript
attaches it to a non-import first declaration. An `@internal` module is omitted.
Module prose does not use the declaration template. Its tags are optional
non-empty `@deprecated`, repeated non-empty `@see`, required `@stability`, then
required stable-semver `@since`. Its examples and links follow the declaration
contracts.

Inline `{@link Symbol}` targets must resolve to TypeScript symbols; use normal
Markdown links for URLs. Prefer code formatting when navigation does not help a
reader understand or choose the API.

Use `@see` only for a verified related public API: a close alternative,
inverse, complement, level variant, or closely returned, consumed, or
configured type. Explain non-obvious relationships. Exclude implementation
dependencies, broad concepts, example-only helpers, private APIs, and merely
lexical matches.
